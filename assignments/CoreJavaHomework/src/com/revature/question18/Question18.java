 * 
 * 1. Check for uppercase characters in a string, and return 'true' or 'false'
 * 	  depending if any are found
 * 2. Convert all of the lower case characters to uppercase in the input string, and
 * return the result
 * 3. Convert the input string to integer and add 10, output the result to the console
